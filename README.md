instruction for fork https://github.com/trc492/Ftctemplate:
To use this repository template, you can clone or fork this template repository to your own github repositories. There are many ways to do it but I am going to describe one way which is using GitHub Desktop. If you are more familiar with other similar tools, feel free to use it instead.

On a web browser, enter the URL https://github.com/trc492/FtcTemplate.
Then, click the "Fork" button near the upper right corner of the web page and answer the question on where you want to fork this repository to your GitHub repositories.
Once the fork is done. Clone your GitHub repository to your computer using your favorite GitHub tool such as GitHub Desktop.
On GitHub Desktop, click File->Clone repository..., select the repository you just forked and type in the path on the computer where you want to clone the repository to.
Congratulations! You just clone our template repository. Now you can fire up Android Studio and import this gradle project. Once that is done, you can now go to TeamCode and browse around the provided template code or sample code. You can compile the code and check if you have any issues with the cloned template. Or you can jump right in and start modifying/customizing the code.
